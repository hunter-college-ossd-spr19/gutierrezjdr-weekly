###OpenSource-NY Update

I worked on the "Making requests through curl with the github REST API." item. I am trying to understand Github's API V4 but it now uses GraphQL.
THe syntax does confuse me so I did a few practice examples but I believe I will have to do more readings. 
I also set up my authorization token  as a developer and did my first curl call which came back as a 200 response showing that all is well.
I will continue reading documentaiton and doing more practice examples on GraphQl.
