### OpenSource-NY Update

I worked on the "Making requests through curl with the github REST API." item. I am trying to understand Github's API V4 but it now uses GraphQL.

THe syntax does confuse me so I did a few practice examples but I believe I will have to do more readings. 
I also set up my authorization token  as a developer and did my first curl call which came back as a 200 response showing that all is well.

I will continue reading documentaiton and doing more practice examples on GraphQl. 


### Update Part 2

This week we determined what needed to be done first which was a login page that asks GitHub for access to that users account.
I opened the [issue](https://github.com/opensource-ny/OpenSource-NY/issues/36) up to start the process for it. I tried to solve this isssue with a [pull request](https://github.com/opensource-ny/OpenSource-NY/pull/37) that added a basic HTML form box and changed the port number
in our express javascript file to 3000. I made usre to ask yizong to review my pull request as I was not sure if I was taking the right steps.   
After discussing wiht my teammates through slack we came to a conclusion. I had misunderstood how React and Express work together as my teammates pointed out that setting the port to 3000 would conflict with our react javascript file. Therefore, I rejected my own pull request. This showed me that I needed more information and education on how react and express work together. For now I am just working on understanding their collaboration before I continue to add code.
