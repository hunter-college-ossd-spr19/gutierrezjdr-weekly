### Empathy Project Evaluation 02


For this exercie, we experienced issues when pulling when an error came up stating 
"Your local changes to the followng files would be overwritten by a merge." 
This occurred because during the time it was being edited someone else had 
already changed it. It was dealt by removing the file, pulling again and 
inserting the information back in the pulled file and then pushing once again.  

Although this project was recommended to be done at the same time,
because of scheduling issues most of us worked at different times and had few 
problems besides the one listed above. The formatting is not consistent across 
the board so discussing formatting would help the readability of the document.
Otherwise, this project went smoothly. 

I also did an error in not reading the instruction properly and adding the above description 
in the summary section thinking it was for a summary over how the group project went. Therefore that is
why I did another commit with the content that was actually being asked of us. 

Although I do work on Tuesday's I was disappointed that I couldn't come to Tuesday's 
class for Christos. Next time I'de prefer to take the time off to come into the class 
for these special events. Hope they happen more often.
