This week we did Project Evaluations for three projects, DOxygen, Netflix Conductor, and OpenFoodFacts Server which was in a seperate repository. Please follow the link [here.](../../../../gutierrezjdr-project-evaluation-01)

__What things do you feel you need to learn the most to be able to contribute to open source projects?__
I need to learn to take extra time to read code and dig through documentation before even starting. Also maybe it would be nice to contribute with comments in code in order to help myself and others. Even when reading code, going back to it a few days later can still be an issue. Comments help even the person creating the code. 

__What are the weak points that you want to strengthen?__
I need to strengthen contacting contibutors and reaching out to those in the community personally. I just look around and try to figure it out by myself but it is quicker to learn something if I ask experienced contributors. Also I need to leave my fear of being seen as "stupid" and build the courage to ask questions without fear of judgement.
