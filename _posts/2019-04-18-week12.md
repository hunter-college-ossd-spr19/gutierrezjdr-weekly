## Wikipedia Contributions

I have changed two link issues. The first was for the [Washington Heights](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_Heights,_Manhattan)
wikipedia page. In the [following reference,](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Washington_Heights,_Manhattan&oldid=896603207) School of the Incarnation
had a link which pointed to a page for Gambrills, Maryland. The second change was on the same line regarding the City College Academy 
of the Arts. The link for this school leads to an error from Wikipedia stating __"The article that you're looking for doesn't exist."__
[I deleted this link as well.](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Washington_Heights,_Manhattan&oldid=896603768)
