## Wikipedia Contributions

I have changed two link issues. The first was for the [Washington Heights](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_Heights,_Manhattan)
wikipedia page. In the [following reference,](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Washington_Heights,_Manhattan&oldid=896603207) School of the Incarnation
had a link which pointed to a page for Gambrills, Maryland. The second change was on the same line regarding the City College Academy 
of the Arts. The link for this school leads to an error from Wikipedia stating __"The article that you're looking for doesn't exist."__
[I deleted this link as well.](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Washington_Heights,_Manhattan&oldid=896603768) 

While loooking through the landmarks I noticed that the United Palace was not there and it was named a landmark in 2016 so I thought it would be appropriate to add it to the list. In my [contribution](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Washington_Heights,_Manhattan&oldid=897978097) I added two sentences briefly describing the theater and its purpose. I also added two links to other wikipedia pages and a source at the end of the sentence. 

In the wikipedia page for the [United Palace](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=United_Palace&oldid=897986914) as I was checking citations I noticed that a citation led to a dead end. The page did not exist. I tried using the [Wayback Machine] but the page was not archived. There I decided to insert a _Citation Needed_ in place of the link. 

For my final contribution I decided to have a little more fun with it and went to the page of one of ym favorite games called 
[Don't Starve Together](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Don%27t_Starve&oldid=897983572). I added a character in the character section that was not there before. I inserted a small description of him and his abilities. 

Overall this project has taught me to never trust Wikipedia specially when there are some dead links. Also Wikipedia does not have all the information about certain topics so it is good to do research outside of Wikipedia especially form local sources.
