## Wikipedia Rumagging

Usually when editing, I tend to do this relating to my community as I know it well. The first page I went to was the 
[Washington Heights](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_Heights,_Manhattan#Points_of_interest) page. I went thorugh the 
Landmarks and attractions section. Even I was suprised by everything that is available in our community. In this section
I can include the [United Palace](https://www.6sqft.com/behind-the-scenes-at-the-united-palace-theatre-washington-heights-opulent-wonder-theatre/)
which is a famour theater where many Latinx singers perform. I thought it would be a grea addition to landmarks but I have to make sure
that it is withing Wikipedia's definition on landmarks. 

I also noticed while looking around that the link for [School of the Incarnation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gambrills,_Maryland) which is a Catholic school is linked to a location called 
Gambrills, Maryland not a page based on the school. I checked it because I was surprised that it had a link while the St. Elizabeth school did not.
I could also try to add a page for St. Elizabeth school as it has been there since 1936. They have an about page that would be great as a source.
