### Open Source Definition

According to the Open Source Inititative coalition, Open Source is where a license allows anyone to see the source code or be able to obtain the source code through easy means, such as downloading from a website. It also includes freedom of distribution but also freedom of choice over wether the program using open source code is in itself open source or not. Part of the requirement is a license that is active to anyone who it is distributed to without a required license add-on. Therefore just by receiving the program, the license is also active through their copy automatically. If the source code itself is modified then the modifications must also have the same rights as the source code and cannot be privatized as it is part of the original source code itself. Also the license cannot discriminate against any group of people or fields/entities. 

### Free Software Definition

Free software, as defined the GNU(also sponsored by the Free Software Foundation), has four central liberties that cannot be defied. This includes running, redistributing, distributing modified versions, and studying the program in anyway you wish. This even includes selling copies of free software. This means there is absolute freedom with the software with no restrictions. The word __FREE__ in the name talks about the users freedom and not about price which is why it can still be considered _FREE_ even after selling redistributions. Free software license is more of an ideology about what can be considered _Free Software_. In this definition there also exists they idea of __copyleft__ where all of the modifications on the original source code must also be free but it is not necessary for software to be considered free software.

### Comparison

~~The biggest difference between these two is that the license in Open Source software is void if the source code and even compiled program is barred from being distributed. This is a big difference because a Free Software license is not void if someone does do this. 
Similarly, if modifications to the source code are blocked from being accesible it automatically voids the open source license but not the free software license as it allows you to sell the source code with modifications.~~

__Update: The following was edited after our class was talking about this subject. Our discussion helped redefine my understanding which was originally wrong. I leave my answer in order to show my changing understanding of this topic.__

 The difference between free source and open source in this instance is that the free source license label is not void as long as it respects the central freedoms defined. Free software is the idea behind open source and open source is an implementation of free software _to an extent_. Open source does not follow the free software philosophy and instead seems to follow practices that are mostly used in the community. Since open source is the application of free sofware it includes licenses that take away the users freedom to add on privatized modifications which strictly goes against free software's four mandatory freedoms. Another big issue is the practice of _tivoization_ in which, according to [Stallman](https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/open-source-misses-the-point.en.html), "only one privileged company can make executables that can run in the device or can access its full capabilities". This ist the biggest, and probably annoying, distinction between both definitions. 


### Editing Open Street Map

The first thing I added was a children's clothing store a block away from Hunter. It is called [Janie and Jack](https://www.yelp.com/biz/janie-and-jack-new-york). It has been opened for a few years but was never added. There was also another kid's store on 1332 3rd avenue called [Gymboree](https://www.yelp.com/biz/gymboree-new-york-5?osq=gymboree). In Washington Heights (yes, this is the neighborhood where Lin-Manuel Miranda's __[In the Heights](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_the_Heights)__ takes place) there were recent [renovations](https://www.dnainfo.com/new-york/20170519/washington-heights/gwb-terminal-where-to-find-whats-inside-store-guide) to the George Washington Bus Terminal. This terminal stations and runs buses to New Jersey. It lies between 178th and 179th and runs from Washington Avenue to Broadway. When renovated, it became a small mall so I added a couple of store. I added a [Marshalls](https://www.openstreetmap.org/changeset/66745152#map=16/40.8485/-73.9344) store and its suite on the George Washington Bus Station. I also added a [Blink Fitness](https://www.openstreetmap.org/changeset/66745496) gym across the street which is also part of the Terminal.


I also added small information to a bus stop at 181st and Amsterdam and set the _MTA_ as the ownee of the bus stop. This bus stop is also a big hub because five buses use this [stop](https://bustime.mta.info/m/index?q=403658) (yes, five). I decided to add them because it is an important stop that take many many people from Upper Manhattan to the Bronx. The routes were added in the _Network_ option. I added the buses [Bx35](https://bustime.mta.info/m/;jsessionid=05F2945FCF493A7E07BC6F899FBA3E50?q=Bx35),[Bx36](https://bustime.mta.info/m/index?q=Bx36&l=&t=),[Bx11](https://bustime.mta.info/m/index?q=Bx11&l=&t=),[Bx13](https://bustime.mta.info/m/index?q=Bx13&l=&t=),[Bx3](https://bustime.mta.info/m/index?q=Bx3&l=&t=) and the locations they come from to the locations they are going to. Most of these start at the George Washington Bus Terminal.
