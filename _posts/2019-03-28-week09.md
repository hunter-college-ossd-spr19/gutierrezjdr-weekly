### Open Source NY Update 

This week I couldn't work as much on the project as I had two exams. I did get a bit of work done on the repository regardless.
First, I suggested that we take the application source code out of the `src` folder it was in. The original path to reach the root
directory of the app was `src/myapp` which was redundant since they are both just folders. It was a folder with only one folder inside that 
contained the code for the app. I created pull request [#5](https://github.com/hunter-college-ossd-spr19/OpenSource-NY/pull/5) on the 
__hunter-college-ossd-spr19/OpenSource-NY fork__. Previously since I was confused, I had done two pull requests with the same code in the original 
repository __opensource-ny/OpenSource-NY__. You can see my failures [#61](https://github.com/opensource-ny/OpenSource-NY/pull/61) and 
[#60](https://github.com/opensource-ny/OpenSource-NY/pull/60). 

I also decided to create an issue [#64](https://github.com/opensource-ny/OpenSource-NY/issues/64) on our git workflow in order to start the discussion. While trying to 
create the issue we noticed we couldn't create it in the ossd19 fork so we concluded that issues will be set in the main repository and closed with pull
requests in the class fork. My purpose for opening this issue was that I wanted to follow the [git workflow pdf](https://github.com/hunter-college-ossd-spr19/github-workflow-activity-01/blob/master/github-workflow-presentation.pdf) 
given during our git workflow in class activity. This was an optional issue and it came up as one contributer, mxmsunny, was having issues. 
Yizong clarified that it was a simple name error. Either way I still wanted to put the idea out and decied to make the changes and opened up 
the pull request [#9](https://github.com/hunter-college-ossd-spr19/OpenSource-NY/pull/9). I left it to the team to decided wether they wanted it or not.
We did have some discussion on wether we should state if "stage and commit" should be in the instructions. I personally do believe we should include it
even though it is known as we might not want to discourage inexperienced coders from working on the project just because they couldn't get their pulls
in. Either way the pull request was accepted and the group agreed.

Next week I hope to work more with the Github API and practice in my own local branch in order to understand it better. I want to see what else we cna 
call and show so that we can set the foundation for the equation that will set up the points system.
