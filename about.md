Some information about me!

### About Me
I was part of the _guinea pig_ class for Professor Weiss' Open Source Software class. It was a great experience and hope to continue working long term on a project this semester. I want to learn Python so I can work on different projects this semester. I like playing video games but college and work has taken most of my time but I hope to use that passion towards supporting open source gaming projects like I did last semester with the game engine [Godot](https://godotengine.org/). I hope to find a similar project.
